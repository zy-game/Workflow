/**
 * Pure types of the goal domain: the ONE home of the `goal` projection-key
 * declaration plus the durable payload vocabulary it carries, free of this
 * package's host-side imports (cordis events, dsh-agent, dsh-llm, the
 * service). Two namespace projections serve it — `./types` for host
 * consumers, `./client` (the browser half-entry's re-export) for client
 * aggregates — with zero content duplication. Host-coupled domain
 * vocabulary (message sources, events, fold shapes) lives in ./domain.ts.
