/**
 * The card that declares a provider pi-ai does not ship — an OpenAI-compatible
 * gateway, a self-hosted server, or a provider newer than the installed
 * catalog.
 *
 * This is a create, not an edit, which is why it is its own card rather than
 * the provider editor with extra fields: the route id is being *chosen* here,
 * and the settings address does not exist until it is. One `settings.mutate`
 * sets the whole profile at `providers.<route>`; the key travels separately
 * through `credentials.set` under the reference the profile records, exactly as
 * an existing provider's key does.
 *
 * The three fields a hand-declared route cannot default — endpoint, protocol,
 * and at least one model — are required here rather than at load, so the
 * failure names the field while the user is still looking at it.
 *
 * There is deliberately no reasoning-effort control, here or on the editor
 * card: effort is a per-MODEL capability, and the models under one provider
 * disagree about it, so a provider-scoped control can only be set to a value
 * some of them reject. The composer's model picker offers each model its own
 * levels instead.
