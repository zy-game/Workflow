 * Menu reduction pure core. One group per source;

 *
 * Roster protocol: the frozen `hit` event carries no source roster, so the
 * reducer cannot invent groups. Opening from a closed state, the shell seeds
 * the roster with {@link seedGroups} and then dispatches `hit`; a `hit`
 * while open (query refinement) resets the existing groups to pending under
 * a new generation. Auto-close and explicit close drop the groups.
