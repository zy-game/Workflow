/**
 * credentials domain contract: the web face of the credential-reference seam
 * (`ctx.credentials`). Reads are structurally value-free — a credential view
 * carries configured/source/writable and has no slot for the value — and the
 * value crosses the wire in exactly one direction, inside `credentials.set`.
 * There is no enumeration method by design: clients learn which references
 * exist from settings schemas and values (`apiKeyEnv` fields).
