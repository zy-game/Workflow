/**
 * Plan mode is logged per-agent collaboration state: while active, a
 * deployment-owned guidance section is included in each model request, and
 * `exit_plan_mode` presents the completed plan for user review, while the
 * `/plan off` command lets a user leave directly. Sandbox mode and approval
 * policy enforce restrictions independently and do not read or write plan
 * state.
 *
 * The state in force is folded from the session log (`plan/mode`, last one
 * wins), so resume and fork restore it without a live mirror. User selections
 * remain pending until the next accepted in-turn pre-step. The service includes
 * the selected state in the proposed step assembly, then appends `plan/mode`
 * from `agent/pre-step` only when the step is accepted. Same-step request
 * retries reuse their assembly.
 *
 * The exit tool remains registered while plan mode is inactive, so entering
 * or leaving plan mode changes only the prompt section, not the request tool
 * catalog.
