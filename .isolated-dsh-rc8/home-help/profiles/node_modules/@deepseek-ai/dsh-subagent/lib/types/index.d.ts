/**
 * Service Definition for the subagent capability seam (`ctx.subagents`): a named-provider registry plus a
 * capability-validating asynchronous start API. Providers establish a
 * child before returning its run, so fulfillment is the single publication and
 * ownership-transfer boundary.
 *
 * Unlike the bash seam (one executor per context, second load throws), MULTIPLE
 * providers coexist here: each registers under a unique name and a caller picks
 * one by name. The shape mirrors the LLM adapter registry
 * (`LlmRuntime.registerAdapter`), not the single-service bash executor.
 *
 * This package owns the Service Definition role of the capability seam. Service Providers
 * (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-subagent-spawn-in-process`, `-fork`, `-acp`) and the model-facing
 * consumer (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-subagent`) are separate packages.
 *
 * Public operations express caller intent: `start` returns one published owned
 * one-shot run, `startContinuable` establishes a durable continuable child, and
 * `followup` delivers later content without exposing whether the child is
 * resident. Continuable children never become a {@link SubagentRun}: the
 * continuation manager holds their `AgentHandle` directly and orders every turn
 * through the child's own inbox, so providers contribute only the detached
 * creation spec and see no handle, turn, or teardown. Child and descendant
 * discovery read the live session store and optional session persistence
 * directly and do not require that continuation runtime.
 *
 * Same-process providers are trusted typed collaborators. Requests, provider
 * descriptors, results, and lifecycle payloads are borrowed immutable values;
 * serialization and hostile-input validation belong at real process, worker,
 * persistence, and model boundaries.
 *
