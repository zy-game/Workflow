/**
 * Configuration schema and provider-profile validation for the pi-ai adapter.
 * Profiles are a dict keyed by provider route, so the composition base and a
 * user-settings layer merge per provider and the route set is structural.
 *
 * A route key is not required to name an installed pi-ai provider. When it does,
 * that provider's endpoint, protocol, display name, and model catalog are the
 * profile's defaults and the profile overrides them field by field; when it does
 * not, the profile is the whole provider declaration. Resolution therefore ends
 * in a built pi-ai `Provider` per route: everything a request needs is decided
 * once, while the configuration key that made a route unserviceable can still be
 * named in the failure.
