/**
 * Generic pi-ai-backed implementation of the Harness LLM seam.
 *
 * Each resolution produces one **immutable** snapshot — the profiles plus a
 * `Models` collection holding the `Provider` each route built — and an
 * operation captures a whole snapshot before its first `await`. A
 * configuration change builds a *new* collection rather than mutating the one
 * in use, because `Models.streamSimple()` is lazy: it resolves the provider
 * when the stream is first consumed, which is after the credential await, so a
 * mutated collection would let a request that started under one configuration
 * finish under another — or fail with a provider that no longer exists. This is
 * what makes the seam's per-step call freeze (`llm.prepareCall()`) hold all the
 * way down: switching models mid-reply takes effect on the next step, never
 * inside the one in flight.
 *
 * Credentials stay outside that collection. The harness resolves a route's key
 * through its own seam and passes it as the request's `apiKey` option, which
 * pi-ai treats as the highest-priority auth override — so `Models` never holds
 * a credential store and the harness keeps its fail-loud reference semantics.
 *
