/**
* Per-session sandbox-mode override: the session log as the store. A runtime
* switch (a UI policy control or test scenario) is recorded as one
* `sandbox/mode` event on the session it applies to;
* `effective = fold(events) ?? the deployment default`, so an override
* survives restart by replay, two sessions can never see each other's state,
* and there is no external config store. The event is log-only (the
* `approval/*` precedent): the policy owner projects the fold into each model
* request, while enforcing tools report operation-specific boundary markers.
* EXECUTION honors the same fold through `ctx.sandboxPolicy.resolve()` — it
* stamps the mode together with the calling session's workspace root onto each
* capability call, weakest-precedence beneath an escalation grant.
*
* The override is policy state shared by every enforcing family (bash and
* filesystem alike), so it lives here in the policy package rather than in any
* one capability's seam.
