/**
 * Per-package browser lifecycle: evaluate the closure, wrap `apply` in the guard
 * facade, seat a ready-made factory in the module table, and create a loader
 * entry — so dynamic packages ride the exact machinery static plugins do
 * (activation gating on inject, fiber-effect cleanup, status projection). Unload
 * = loader entry removal (fiber disposal cascades slot entries and facade
 * effects) + factory invalidation + style removal.
 *
 * The engine answers its caller: `load` resolves with what this page ended up
 * with, which is what the run orchestration reports back to the host. Loads
 * converge by Plugin Run ID against live state, not history: loading the exact
 * activation this page already runs is a no-op that still answers, another run
 * replaces it, and the same Package after a retract loads afresh. Per-Plugin
 * serialization keeps a second request from interleaving with one in flight.
