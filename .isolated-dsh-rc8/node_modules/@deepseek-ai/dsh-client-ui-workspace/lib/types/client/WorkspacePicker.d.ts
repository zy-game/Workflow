/**
 * Workspace pick/add flow. WorkspacePickFlow is the reusable core (menu +
 * path error dialog) consumed directly by WorkspaceBrowser (same package) and
 * wrapped by WorkspacePicker for the conversation empty-state slot
 * registration. Directory picking itself lives in the composed flow package's
 * slot occupant (see the contract module doc): this core only opens the flow,
 * adopts the picked path, and owns the error surface. Adding a workspace has
 * exactly one route — pick a host directory, new or existing — because the
 * occupant's own create-folder affordance already covers creating one.
