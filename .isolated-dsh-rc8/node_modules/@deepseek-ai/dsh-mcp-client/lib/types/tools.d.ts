 *    generation of `ToolDefinition`s under public names. Any failure here
 *    (network error, duplicate raw name in the server's list) rejects and
 *    leaves the previous generation registered untouched.
 * 2. Swap: dispose the previous generation, register the new one. A registry
 *    conflict here can only mean a foreign registration squats on this
 *    server's `mcp__<serverName>__` namespace — the partial generation is
 *    rolled back (zero tools from this server) and logged. Initial strict
 *    synchronization may propagate the conflict so its parent transaction
 *    rejects; ordinary clients and later re-syncs return an empty map.
 *
 * @param client - Connected MCP Client instance used to list and call tools.
 * @param ctx - Cordis context providing the `tools` service for registration.
 * @param opts - Bridge options: server namespace and per-call timeout.
 * @param previous - Disposer map from the prior sync generation; disposed
 *   during the swap phase (only after the fetch phase succeeded).
 * @returns A map of registered public tool names to their unregister
 *   disposers — the exact set of live registrations owned by this server.
