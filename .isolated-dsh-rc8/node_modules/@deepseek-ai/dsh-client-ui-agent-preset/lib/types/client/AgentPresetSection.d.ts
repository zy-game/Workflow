/**
 * Agent-presets settings section: the roster as cards, a copy dialog as the
 * only way a preset is created, and a read-only viewer over the shipped
 * compositions.
 *
 * The browser edits no composition text — a shipped preset opens read-only to
 * be READ (it is the known-good composition a copy starts from), and a custom
 * preset is edited in its own files, which is what the location action leads
 * to. Deleting a preset leaves running sessions alone: a composition is
 * mounted once at session creation and nothing re-reads the file.
