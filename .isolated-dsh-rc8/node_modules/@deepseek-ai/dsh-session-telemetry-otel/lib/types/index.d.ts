/**
 * OpenTelemetry Service Provider for the DeepSeek Harness telemetry capability.
 *
 * Composes the OTel JS SDK as-is — a `LoggerProvider` with a
 * `BatchLogRecordProcessor` and an OTLP/HTTP log exporter — and maps each
 * record handed over by the capture coordinator onto `logger.emit()`. After that call,
 * batching, retry, queueing, and loss policy use the SDK's documented behavior, configured
 * verbatim through the `exporter`/`processor` passthroughs. This package owns
 * capture mode and an outer shutdown deadline: the SDK's export timeout does
 * not bound its preceding `forceFlush()` wait.
 *
