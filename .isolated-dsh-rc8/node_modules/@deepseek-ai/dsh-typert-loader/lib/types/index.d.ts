/**
 * Typert Loader integration: automatic registration for mounted plugin packages.
 *
 * When a loader entry mounts, this plugin resolves the entry's package.json; a
 * package exporting `./typert` has its host face imported and its
 * `TYPERT` manifest registered into `ctx.typert`, and the registration is
 * withdrawn when the entry unmounts. Explicit `packages` cover plugins nested
 * behind another Loader entry, whose Cordis fibers carry no resolvable package
 * specifier. Packages without the export are skipped silently when discovered
 * from Loader entries; an explicit package or declared artifact that is broken
 * fails loud — aggregated into this plugin's activation throw for existing
 * entries, contained to a logged error per package in steady state.
 *
 * Scanning is incremental per entry name, mirroring the client-modules node
 * half: every cordis `internal/plugin` emission marks the fiber's entry name
 * dirty and a microtask flush reconciles each dirty name against the live
 * loader entries; the activation pass seeds the same dirty set with all
 * current entries. Package verdicts and imported manifests are cached per
 * package name and never expire — plugin-set changes take effect on restart.
 *
 * Manual `ctx.typert.register()` remains available for contributions
 * that do not use a `./typert` artifact (hand-written wire schemas,
 * tests, non-loader compositions).
 *
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-typert-loader
