/**
 * The model list of one pi-ai provider profile, plus the action that asks the
 * provider what it serves.
 *
 * The list is the profile's `models` array as the card holds it: an empty list
 * means "serve this route's built-in catalog", and any entry replaces that
 * catalog, so a row is only ever added deliberately. Fetching asks the endpoint
 * **the form currently shows** — including a key typed but not yet saved — so
 * adding a provider is one pass instead of save-then-return; the reply is
 * candidates the user picks from, never configuration written behind them.
 *
 * A provider that cannot be interrogated (an unreachable endpoint, a protocol
 * with no readable listing) is not a dead end: the failure is shown next to the
 * rows the user can still fill in by hand.
