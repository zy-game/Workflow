* absent both means a clean exit 0.
*
* The consumed marker is removed from `body` because a terminal presentation
* shows the exit status as its own pill: leaving the marker in the output
* would render the exit twice. Other markers (timeout, sandbox denial) carry
* facts no pill shows, so they stay in the body.
*
* Replay only retains the rendered content text, not the original
* `ShellRunResult`, so terminal presentation must recover the exit pill here.
* Requiring a leading newline and the end of the string keeps ordinary output
* that merely ends with marker-like text from matching unless the final line
* is indistinguishable from a real marker.
* @param text - rendered model-facing shell-tool result.
