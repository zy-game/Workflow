* @deepseek-ai/dsh-cmdline — the command line a dsh launcher hands to the app
* it boots.
*
* The launcher parses only its own flags (`--profile`, `--patch`, the config
* dumps) and hands everything after them to the tree verbatim through the
* {@link CmdlineArgs} service, so an app owns its flag family, its `--help`
* text, and its parse errors instead of the launcher knowing them.
*
* Any app plugin can inject `cmdlineArgs` and call {@link parseCmdline}. A
* provider may publish the parsed values as its own service from its program's
* commander action, and ordinary rows
* can inject that service and read it from lazily resolved config —
* `port: !!js ctx.webStartup.port ?? 3080` — so a flag beats the value written
* beside it. No row has launcher-level command-line status.
