* up with exactly the stated mode. `withFileLock` serializes cross-process
* writers of one file through a `wx`-created `<file>.lock` sibling, so a

* replaced; readers stay lock-free because the rename commit is atomic.

* rename, so replacing a wider-permission file narrows it without a chmod
* race. The rename also replaces a symlinked target itself instead of writing
* through to its referent, and the same-directory sibling keeps the rename on
* one filesystem. On any failure the temp file is removed and the failure
* rethrown. Crash durability (fsync) is out of scope.
