/**
 * Shared execution plumbing for the `glob` / `grep` search tools: the
 * package-owned `SEARCH_*` error vocabulary, one spawn helper that runs the
 * PACKAGED ripgrep binary (`@vscode/ripgrep`) with a plain argv vector and
 * returns complete raw stdout, the best-effort formatted-result spill handoff,
 * and workdir-relative path display.
 *
 * Both tools execute as ordinary foreground spawns through `ctx.subprocess` —
 * never `ctx.shell`, never `ctx.shell.start()`, never a model-visible background
 * task. The ripgrep binary ships inside the npm package, so no system `rg`
 * install is required, and no shell layer exists between the argv vector and
 * ripgrep, so no shell quoting is involved. Raw `rg` stdout is an internal
 * transport detail: the tools request a per-run stdout capture budget from the
 * subprocess seam, parse only complete in-memory stdout within
 * `rawOutputMaxBytes`, and never read spill files. The model-facing recovery
 * artifact is the formatted result saved through `ctx.spillStore.saveText()`
 * ({@link trySaveFormattedResult}).
