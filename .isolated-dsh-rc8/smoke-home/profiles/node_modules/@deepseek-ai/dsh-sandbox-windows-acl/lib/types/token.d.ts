 * pass-2 check grants only what the restricting list carries, keeping that
 * workspace grant inert under read-only while the unrevoked ACE keeps the
 * re-upgrade free (the grant's exact-ACE skip — no re-propagation).
 * Everyone's own ambient grants remain the documented partial boundary.
 * Authenticated Users is absent from BOTH lists: the WMI
 * namespace security check fails (0x80041003), so CIM is unavailable in
 * every confined mode, and the C:\-root tree-creation escape (standing
 * `AU:(AD)` + `AU:(OI)(CI)(IO)(M)` ACEs) is closed in both — documented in
 * README. INTERACTIVE/LOCAL are absent from BOTH lists too — the host's
 * Public tree grants write to INTERACTIVE, so removing it closes that
 * escape. S-1-2-1 (console logon) is intentionally absent: see win32-abi.ts
 * for the verified failure modes. FAILS CLOSED: any failure throws — never
 * spawn unrestricted.
 * @param api - the binding table.
 * @param currentToken - the process token to restrict.
 * @param logonSid - the copied logon session SID.
 * @param writeSids - the distinct write SIDs forming the workspace and

 * @param known - the well-known SIDs entering the restricting list.
 * @param mode - selects the restricting list (workspace-write adds the capability SIDs).
