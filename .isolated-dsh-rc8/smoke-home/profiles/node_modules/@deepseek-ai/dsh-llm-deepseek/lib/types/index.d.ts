 * load: the plugin layers its `cordis.yml` entry config under the optional
 * `llm-deepseek` user-settings section (`ctx.settings`) and resolves the API
 * key through the optional credential seam (`ctx.credentials`), so a changed
 * base URL, catalog, or key reaches the very next request without restarting
 * anything, while an in-flight stream keeps the facts it started with. The
 * one registration-captured fact — the retry policy — re-registers the route
 * in place when it changes.
