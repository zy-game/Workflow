/**
 * One provider's editor card, hand-written per adapter family: the primary
 * field is a single write-only **API key** input (the page never asks for an
 * environment-variable name — a typed key stores through `credentials.set`
 * under the profile's reference, deriving `<ROUTE>_API_KEY` when the profile
 * has none. The pi-ai profile records that derivation as `apiKeyEnv` only when
 * a key is entered; a blank key materializes a reference-free profile for
 * provider-native authentication);
 * the collapsed 自定义设置 area carries the per-family extras (`baseURL` for
 * both families, DeepSeek's id/name/context-window model catalog, and the
 * display name and wire protocol of a pi-ai route the adapter does not ship —
 * the two fields the create card asked that route for, editable here for the
 * same reason).
 * Reasoning effort is deliberately absent: it is a per-MODEL capability, and
 * the models under one provider disagree about it, so a provider-scoped
 * control can only be set to a value some of them reject. The composer's
 * model picker offers each model its own levels; `settings.yaml` keeps the
 * profile field for a deployment that knows its route. Everything else stays
 * owned by `settings.yaml`. Profile edits land as minimal `settings.mutate`
 * path ops against the stored section — the card names only the fields it can
 * see instead of rebuilding the whole subtree from a partial descriptor.
