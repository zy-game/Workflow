/**
 * Opt-in request-preparation tmux-location context. Eligible step attempts
 * append durable, source-attributed context naming the tmux session, window,
 * and pane this agent process runs in, plus the window's pane-tree layout.
 *
 * The plugin pulls state once per turn, for the first request (`step === 1`), by
 * running one `tmux display-message` through the `ctx.shell` executor service. It
 * confirms this process genuinely runs inside the pane `$TMUX_PANE` names by
 * matching the pane's `#{pane_tty}` against this process's controlling terminal,
 * so a terminal that merely inherited `$TMUX`/`$TMUX_PANE` from a tmux ancestor
 * (e.g. a VS Code integrated terminal) reads as "not in tmux". It re-injects
 * only when the rendered tmux state changes since the last injection (a moved,
 * renamed, or re-laid-out pane), with an optional `refreshIntervalMs` floor
 * between injections. Absent tmux environment, an inherited-only environment,
 * absent `ctx.shell`, or a failed query is a no-op, never an error: an executor
 * rejection is contained and logged as a warning so the turn continues.
