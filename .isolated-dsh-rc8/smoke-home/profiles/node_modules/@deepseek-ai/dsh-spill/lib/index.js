* `@deepseek-ai/dsh-spill-local` (host filesystem) is the first.
*

* retention policy (that is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-output-retention`), NO tool-result
* replacement (that is `@deepseek-ai/dsh-spill-policy`), and NO retrieval or

* Abstract spill storage service. Subclass, implement {@link saveText}, and load
* the subclass as a plugin — it registers as `ctx.spillStore` (one
* implementation per context; loading a second throws, cordis' standard
* duplicate-service behavior).
*
* Semantics every implementation must honor:
* - {@link saveText} persists the FULL `content` verbatim and returns an opaque
*   locator, exact byte length, and model-facing retrieval guidance.
* - Storage is scoped by the request's {@link SaveTextSpill.owner} session; the
*   backend chooses a private (not world-readable) location and a collision-free
*   name derived from — never equal to — the caller's `suggestedName`.
* - `saveText` REJECTS on a real storage failure (permissions, ENOSPC, backend
*   unavailable); the caller decides how to degrade (the spill policy treats a
*   rejection as best-effort and keeps the inline result).
