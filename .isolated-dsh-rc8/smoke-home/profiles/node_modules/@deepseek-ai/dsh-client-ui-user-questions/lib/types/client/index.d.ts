/**
 * Web question plugin, browser half: QuestionComposer registered as a
 * selector-routed entry of the conversation-declared composer chain, plus the
 * `question` dictionaries. The selector narrows the owner's currency to the
 * question carrier (matched prop), and the whole behavior surface rides the
 * carrier (domain encoding in contract/slots.ts PendingQuestion); copy rides
 * the standard locale seat. Export discipline: packages/client/AGENTS.md.
 *
 * One entry, two shapes: the composer renders a request that declares a
 * presentation intent as that intent's own surface (`plan-review` → the plan
 * decision card) and every other request as the generic question flow. A
 * separate chain entry per shape would race the same carrier, so the shape
 * choice lives inside this entry — see QuestionComposer.
